abstract = {This paper presents the iRobot corporation's Roomba vacuum as a low-cost resource for robotics research and education. Sensor and actuation models for unmodified Roombas are presented in the context of both special- and general-purpose spatial-reasoning algorithms, including Monte Carlo Localization and FastSLAM. Further tests probe the feasibility of sensor extensions to the platform. Results demonstrate that, with some caveats, the Roomba is a viable foundation for both classroom and laboratory use, especially for work seeking to leverage robots to other ends, as well as robotics per se with a computational focus.},

@techreport{BaerwaldR.S.1977,
abstract = {The potential spacecraft contaminants in the exhaust plume of a 0. 89N (0.2 lbf) monopropellant hydrazine thruster were measured in an ultrahigh vacuum molecular sink facility. The engine plume was directed toward five quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) located at angles of approximately 0, + or - 15, and + or - 30 degrees with respect to the nozzle centerline. The crystal temperatures were controlled such that the mass adhering to the crystal surface at temperatures of from 106 K to 256 K degrees could be measured. Thruster duty cycles of 25 ms on/5 seconds off, 100 ms on/10 seconds off, and 200 ms on/20 seconds off were investigated. The change in contaminant production with thruster life was assessed by subjecting the thruster to a 100,000 pulse aging sequence and comparing the before and after contaminant deposition rates. The predominant contaminant at a surface temperature of 106 degrees K was postulated to be ammonia, while water and undecomposed hydrazine probably represent the primary constituents remaining on a surface at 144 degrees K. The deposits on higher temperature surfaces were much more difficult to characterize, but small amounts of water and hydrazine, which subsequently revaporize, hydrazine compounds, and aniline or aniline-derived hydrocarbons are likely candidates. Duty cycle appeared to have little effect on contaminant production except as the duty cycle influenced the average propellant flowrate. A decrease in the contaminants measured by the 144 degrees K surface and an increase in deposits on the 172 K and 200 degrees K surfaces were noted as the thruster was aged.  },
