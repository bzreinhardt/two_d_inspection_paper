\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a starting point for induction coupler technology. It describes the physics of spinning magnet arrays that produce contactless force and torque on any conductive target. Preliminary experiments verified and measured these forces, which are both larger and less power-hungry than other contactless actuators. Simulations have demonstrated how the force can be used to maneuver an inspection vehicle. 

Induction couplers offer the prospect of inter-body force that enables close-proximity inspection of a larger target vehicle by a smaller chaser spacecraft, all without mechanical contact. There are many paths for future induction coupler research that extends this key conclusion. This analysis included only planar motion. Future work will explore full six-degree-of-freedom maneuverability.
